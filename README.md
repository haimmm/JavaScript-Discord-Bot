# balaBot
Project name: balaBot (Discord bot)

Language: node js


Introduction:
This is just really small bot I created for Discord - a popular gamers platform with servers and voice chats.
My friend asked me to make him this bot, and I had 0 experience with the api, js, or node.
I learned all the stuff from basic syntax, Discord api, how to host it on cloud and connect it to Discord.
All of this took me around 10 hours, including a lot of googling, youtube, and stack overflow.

bot description:
Firstly the bot supose to trigger everytime theres is a change in any of the voice chat rooms.
Then the bot checks if my friend (recognized by unique ID given to all users) entered to the voice chat.
If thats the case, the bot follows him to the voice chat room and play an audio file some friends recorded (to welcome him with a funny song).
**the bot uses FFmpeg, an opensource service to stream audio files.
After that the bot goes to sleep for few hours to avoid abusing and that's it.
